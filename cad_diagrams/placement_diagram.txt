a = angle between sensors
b = depth of mobile platform body
c = depth of the ultrasonic transducer
d = ultrasonic transducer beam angle

e = length of perpendicular line between mobile platform centre and chord of circle (dotted) with radius equal to mobile platform depth and transducer depth combined
f = angle between transducer beam boundary and base of triangle forming blind spot
g = angle between base of triangle formed by blind spot and line on which transducer is mounted
h = base of right angle triangle created by splitting isosoles triangle forming sensor blind spot
i = height of isosoles triangle forming by splitting isosoles triangle forming sensor blind spot

j = intersection point of transducer beam patterns from transducer face, the distance at which the range finder blind spot starts

a = given
b = given
c = given
d = given

e = (b + c) * cos(a/2) -> due to right angle triangle formed when bisecting angle a
180 = (d / 2) + f + g -> due to the bisection of angle d and isosoles triangle formed between a and the two lines on which the transducers are mounted
180 = a + (2 * g) -> due to isosoles triangle formed between a and the two lines on which the transducers are mounted
f = 180 - (d / 2) - g
g = (180 - a) / 2
h = (b + c) * sin(a / 2)
i = h * tan(f)
j = i - (b + c - e)

j = (((b + c) * sin(a / 2)) * tan((180 - (d / 2) - ((180 - a) / 2)))) - (b + c - ((b + c) * cos(a/2)))

j = (b+c) (sin(a/2) tan(1/2 (a-d+180))+cos(a/2)-1)
